## Sorting and searching

### Introduction to Sorting
We need sorting to improve search algorithms

We can use also to find how much things have. But also we can use to prepare to fast data processing and Construct an optimal solution.

Given two sequence A = [A1, ..., An] and B = [B1,...Bn]


## Quicksort
Invented by Tony Hoare.
Split the array in two parts L and R such that Li <= Rj for all i and j.
Why is quick if it takes O(N^2)? Because the average running time is O(N*logN)

## Quicksort modification
Some sources suggest to use the pivot as (s + e) / 2..
Tha best solution is to chose a random pivot.

## Mergesort
Another Divide and Conquer algorithm.
Split the array into two equal halves
Sort the parts and merge the results.
It needs extra strach memory.
