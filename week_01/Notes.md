# EDX Coding Competitions Week 1

### What is a programming competition?
Is a intellectual sport. They give a set of problem from number theyor, graph tehory, gemotry, string analys and data structures. Algoritms, cryptogramy, machine learning, bigdata.

### Rules
We can use computers or notebook and pen. They give an envelope with problems to solve

### Steps

1. Watch all the problems and choose the easiest one
2. Try to resolve the problem
3. If is "accept" go to the next one

### Benefits
Typical is glory, fame, devices or money. And also an opportunity from IT recruiters to find someone.

**Problem solving skill:** Deep knowledge of algorithms and data structures, understanding of colleagues code, teamwork, and understanding codes'scope are trained at programming competition and very useful for software engineers.

### Algorithmic Programming competitions
ACM International Collegiate Programming Contenst. 

### Problem example
Input: 10+20-3030
wrong: 10+20-3+030
wrong: 10+20-30+30
success: 10+20-3+0+30
